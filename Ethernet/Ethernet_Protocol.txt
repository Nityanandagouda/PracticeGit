>Ehernet is mainly used for- ADAS and HMI.
  1.Driver Monitoring Camera
  2.Digital Video Recorder
  3.Front Looking Camera
  4. Parking Assistance system
   5. front,side and read looking Radar/Lidar

>Advantage of Ethernet
  1.Switch Medium
  2.Larger messages upto 1500bytes
   3.Higher bandwidth(100m-1000mbps)
   4.Speed can be modified.
    5.full duplex communication

>Power Over Data Line-PODL
>Media Indipendent Interface-MII
>Depending upone which type of physical layer we are using based
   on that we use Suitable MII
>Types Of MMI's
  1.Reduced Media-Independent interface-RMII
  2.Gigabit -GMII
  3.Reduced gigabit -RGMII
  4.Serial Gigabit-SGMII
  5.High serial gigabit -HSGMII
  6.quad serial gigabit-QSGMIIEh
  7.10gigabit -XGMII

>IEEE-1722 -AVB protocol
>Automotic Ethernet Frame formate
>Ethernet is a Socket or Network based communication protocol
 Media independent i nterface provides the smooth communication 
   between the physical and MAC layer
>In ethernet protocol we are sending and receiving the data in teh formate of PACKETS using IP
>Comm converts the signal into packets and vice versa
